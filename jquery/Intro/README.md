- jquery is an interface for underlying javascript

```javascript

        $(document).ready(function() {
        $("#div").fadeOut(1000);
        });
        //when the document is ready, select the element with the id of "div" and have it fade out
        //Whatever goes in .ready() parentheses is the JQuery event that occurs when the doc is ready
```
